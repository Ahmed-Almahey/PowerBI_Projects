# AdventureWorks Power BI Analytics Project

This project is a comprehensive Power BI data model and dashboard built on Microsoft's **AdventureWorks** dataset. The focus is on dimensional modeling, DAX measure creation, and interactive reporting using advanced Power BI features like bookmarks, drill-through, and Q&A.

## 📁 Data Source

- **AdventureWorks Sample Database**  
  [Official Microsoft Installation Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/samples/adventureworks-install-configure?view=sql-server-ver15&tabs=ssms)

- **Data Connectivity Mode**: Import

- **Custom SQL Views Created**:
  - `vw_DimProducts`
  - `vw_DimSalesPersons`
  - `vw_DimShipMethods`
  - `vw_DimStatuses`
  - `vw_DimTerritories`
  - `vw_FactOrderDetails`

## 🛠 SQL Data Preparation

Custom SQL views were written to prepare and transform raw AdventureWorks tables into analysis-ready dimensional tables following the star schema. Key operations include:

- Joins to normalize product category and subcategory
- Mapping status IDs to descriptive values
- Deriving line-level financial fields: `TaxAmount`, `TotalDue`, `Freight`
- Flattening role-playing dates (Order, Ship, Due)

## 🧠 Power BI Modeling

- **Model Type**: Star Schema
- **Role-Playing Dimensions**: `OrderDate`, `ShipDate`, `DueDate` (using `USERELATIONSHIP`)
- **Hierarchies**:
  - Product Hierarchy: Category → Subcategory → Product
  - Date Hierarchy: Year → Month → Day

### ➕ Calculated Table

- `DimDates` table created in Power BI using DAX with the following columns:
  - Year, Month, Day
  - Month Name, Day Name

## 📊 Measures Created (DAX)

- `# Orders`
- `Total SubTotal`
- `Total Tax`
- `Total Freight`
- `Total Due`
- `Max Qty per Product`

> All measures also added to a DAX table for quick reference and visualization.

## 📈 Visualizations & Interactivity

- **Line Chart** using counts over role-playing dates with `USERELATIONSHIP`
- **Drill Down** on date and product hierarchies
- **Drill Through** to detail pages (e.g., by SalesPerson or Territory)
- **Bookmarks** to toggle between charts (Show/Hide functionality)
- **Matrix Chart**:  
  - Rows: Territories  
  - Columns: Years  
  - Values: Total Sales, Total Canada Sales
- **Q&A Visual**: Natural language querying
- **Slicers** on two pages with sync enabled

## 🎨 Design & Usability

- Clean and professional layout
- Synchronized slicers for consistency
- Intuitive chart titles and tooltip configurations
- Color palette selected for readability and accessibility

## 📚 Skills Demonstrated

- Data Modeling (Star Schema, Hierarchies, Role-playing Dimensions)
- SQL (Joins, Views, Field Calculations)
- DAX (Measures, USERELATIONSHIP, Time Intelligence)
- Power BI (Bookmarks, Drill Through, Sync Slicers, Q&A)
- Interactive Dashboard Design
- Data Visualization Best Practices
